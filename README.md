FortiGate Lab & Configuration Overview

This repository contains my FortiGate lab configurations and experiments, covering firewall policies, NAT, VPNs, web filtering, IPS, HA, and SD-WAN.

Objective

The goal of this project was to gain practical, hands-on experience with FortiGate features and understand how to configure, monitor, and troubleshoot them in a realistic network environment.

How I Managed the Lab

Step-by-Step Process:

Lab Setup

Built a lab environment using FortiGate devices and virtual machines.

Configured interfaces, VLANs, and management access for safe testing.

Incremental Configuration

Configured firewall policies, NAT, VPNs, SD-WAN, and HA step by step, validating each stage.

Testing & Verification

Tested connectivity, failover, and security policies.

Used logs, monitoring tools, and debug commands to verify proper behavior.

Documentation & Tracking

Recorded each configuration in Markdown files for easy reference.

Tracked issues, fixes, and changes to ensure reproducibility.

Analysis & Troubleshooting

Simulated real-world scenarios (SSL-VPN access, HA failover, traffic filtering).

Identified misconfigurations and applied corrective actions.

Reflection & Conclusion

Evaluated what worked, what required adjustments, and interactions between features.

Summarized lessons learned and practical takeaways.

Key Learnings & Conclusion

Hands-on mastery of FortiGate features: Policies, NAT, VPNs, web filtering, IPS, HA, and SD-WAN.

Practical troubleshooting experience: Solved HA failover, VPN connectivity, and security policy issues.

Secure and efficient management: Implemented best practices while maintaining operational efficiency.

Documentation skills: Maintained clear records for reproducibility and knowledge sharing.
