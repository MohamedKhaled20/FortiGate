This project is a complete documentation of my Fortinet FortiGate learning journey — designed to help anyone who wants to understand firewall concepts in a clear, practical way.

I built this roadmap after realizing how difficult it can be to find structured, hands-on material for FortiGate.
Here, you’ll find my lab results, configurations, step-by-step notes, and final conclusions covering:

🔹 Initial Configuration & Backups

🔹 Firewall Policies & NAT

🔹 High Availability (HA)

🔹 VLANs & Routing

🔹 IPsec VPNs

🔹 Proxy-Based Antivirus & SSL Deep Inspection
