### **🔌Interfaces**
![[Pasted image 20251031172905.png]]

#### 1. **LAN Interface (port2) - The Internal Network**

This is where all our internal devices like computers, printers, and phones connect.

- **Status:** Active and running
    
- **IP Address:** 10.0.0.100 with subnet mask 255.255.255.0
    
- **What this means:** The firewall acts as the gateway at 10.0.0.100 for our entire internal network (10.0.0.x)
    
- **Management access:** We can access the firewall's web interface (HTTPS) and ping it from inside our network

#### 2. WAN Interface (port1) - The Internet Connection

This connects us to the outside world and the internet.

- **Status:** Active and running
    
- **IP Address:** 192.168.1.22 with subnet mask 255.255.255.0
    
- **What this means:** Our firewall gets its internet connection through this IP, probably from a modem or upstream router
    
- **Management access:** HTTPS and ping are enabled here too
    
- **Important note:** Having web management (HTTPS) enabled on the internet-facing port can be a security risk if not properly secured
    

#### 3. DMZ Interface (port3) - For Public Servers

- This is set up for servers that need to be accessible from the internet, like web servers or email servers.

- **Status:** Currently turned off
    
- **IP Address:** 30.0.0.100 with subnet mask 255.255.255.0 (ready to use when needed)
    
- **Purpose:** Creates a separate, more secure zone for public-facing services



###  **🗺️STATIC ROUTES**
![[Pasted image 20251031195916.png]]

**Static Routes** configuration on the FortiGate firewall, accessible under **Network > Static Routes**. This area defines the manual, fixed paths the firewall uses to direct network traffic.

#### 🛣️ Static Route Entry - The Default Route

The single entry in this table is the most critical: the **Default Route**. It tells the firewall where to send any traffic destined for a network it doesn't already know about—which is essentially all traffic bound for the **Internet**.

| **Parameter**   | **Value**       | **🧭 Purpose**                                   |
| --------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Destination** | **0.0.0.0/0**   | The wildcard for **"all networks."**             |
| **Gateway IP**  | **192.168.1.1** | The **Next-Hop Router** (ISP modem/router).      |
| **Interface**   | **WAN (port1)** | The **Physical Exit Port** for external traffic. |
| **Status**      | **Enabled**     | The route is currently active.                   |
**What this means:**

- **0.0.0.0/0** acts as the network's **"map to the world."**
    
- Any packet that doesn't match a local network (like the LAN or DMZ) gets sent to the gateway at **192.168.1.1** via the WAN port.

##### **🛑 IMPORTANT NOTE:** We use a static route **only if** we choose the **Static IP option** on the WAN interface. If the WAN interface were configured for **DHCP**, the default route would be learned and installed **automatically** by the firewall.
### **🛡️ Firewall Policy**
![[Pasted image 20251031202019.png]]
#### 📜 Policy List Entry: To_Internet

The table shows the single explicit policy that has been configured: the **To_Internet** rule.

|**Field**|**Value**|**🧭 Purpose**|
|---|---|---|
|**Policy**|**To_Internet**|The name of the rule.|
|**Source**|**Local_Subnet**|The traffic must originate from the **internal LAN**.|
|**Destination**|**all**|The traffic is permitted to go to **any external destination**.|
|**Service**|**ALL**|All common protocols and ports are allowed.|
|**Action**|**ACCEPT**|Traffic matching the criteria is permitted (allowed) to pass.|
|**NAT**|**NAT**|**Network Address Translation** is enabled, which is required for internal, private IP addresses to communicate with the public internet.|
|**Security Profiles**|**no-inspection**|No advanced security scanning (like IPS or Anti-Virus) is currently applied to this traffic.|

**What this means:**

- This single rule handles all outbound traffic: **LAN (port2)** traffic from the **Local_Subnet** is allowed to go to the **WAN (port1)** interface to **all** external destinations, and NAT is performed to translate the internal source addresses.
    

#### 🚫 The Implicit Deny Rule

Below the explicit policy, there is a crucial entry:

- **Implicit** ⓘ: This represents the **Implicit Deny** rule.
    

> **Crucial Point:** The Implicit Deny is a built-in, unchangeable firewall rule that sits at the very end of the policy list. Its purpose is to **deny** any traffic that does not match one of the rules above it. It is the fundamental security principle ensuring that if a policy is forgotten or misconfigured, the traffic is dropped rather than accidentally permitted.

#### 📜 Policy Details

This policy is configured to allow users on the local network to access the internet.

|**Parameter**|**Value**|**🧭 Purpose**|
|---|---|---|
|**Name**|**To_Internet**|Descriptive name indicating the policy's purpose.|
|**Action**|**✅ ACCEPT**|The firewall will permit (allow) the traffic that matches this rule.|
|**Incoming interface**|**LAN (port2)**|Traffic must originate from the **Internal Network** (LAN).|
|**Outgoing interface**|**WAN (port1)**|Traffic will be sent out to the **Internet** (WAN).|
|**Schedule**|**always**|The policy is active 24/7.|

###  📍 Address Object Configuration 

This screen displays the **Edit Address** panel on the FortiGate firewall, accessed via **Policy & Objects > Addresses**. Address objects are essential components that represent network hosts, subnets, or IP ranges, allowing them to be easily referenced in Firewall Policies.

#### 📝 Object Definition Details

This specific object defines the network range for the **Local Area Network (LAN)**.

|**Parameter**|**Value**|**🧭 Purpose**|
|---|---|---|
|**Name**|**Local_Subnet**|The friendly name used to identify this object in policies.|
|**Type**|**Subnet**|Indicates that this object defines a range of IP addresses.|
|**IP/Netmask**|**10.0.0.0/255.255.255.0**|The actual network definition. This represents the entire **10.0.0.x** network.|
|**Interface**|**any**|The object can be used on any interface, though it logically belongs to the LAN (port2).|
|**Color**|**Change (Orange)**|A visual tag used for quick identification in the policy list.|

**What this means:**

- This object, **Local_Subnet**, is a **defined variable** that represents the network **10.0.0.0 with a /24 subnet mask**.
    
- By creating this object, we don't need to type the full IP/Netmask every time. We can simply select **Local_Subnet** in the **Source** field of a Firewall Policy (as seen in the previous _To_Internet_ policy).
