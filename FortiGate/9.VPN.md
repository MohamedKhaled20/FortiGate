## 1.🔒 SSL-VPN 

**SSL-VPN** (Secure Sockets Layer Virtual Private Network) is a technology that allows remote users to securely access your internal network resources (like servers and file shares) from anywhere, using an encrypted connection. The configuration process involves setting up users, defining _how_ they connect (the portal), configuring the main VPN settings, and creating firewall policies to allow their traffic.

### 🖥️ SSL-VPN Modes

### 1. Web Mode

- **Requirement:** Only a **web browser**.
    
- **Access:** Limited to "bookmarks" for specific web-based resources (HTTP, RDP, SSH, etc.).
    
- **Best For:** Simple, clientless access to basic internal sites or servers.
    

---

### 2. Tunnel Mode

- **Requirement:** Must install **FortiClient** software.
    
- **Access:** Provides **full network access** (like being in the office) by creating a virtual network adapter.
    
- **Best For:** Complete access to all applications (custom software, VoIP, etc.) for remote workers.

#### 🛑 Important Note: Split Tunneling

- **Split Tunneling :** This is the **most efficient** setting. **Only** traffic for the internal private network is sent through the VPN. All other internet traffic goes directly out the user's local connection, which **conserves bandwidth** but **cannot be inspected** by the FortiGate.
### ⚙️ SSL-VPN Configuration Steps 

### 1. Set up Users/Groups

![[Pasted image 20251104203226.png]]

- **Requirement:** Create user accounts (**User & Authentication**).
    
- **Purpose:** Define _who_ can connect.
    

---

### 2. Configure SSL-VPN Portals

![[Pasted image 20251104203803.png]]

- **Requirement:** Define _how_ users connect (Web vs. Tunnel Mode).
    
- **Purpose:** Assign specific access methods.
    

---

### 3. Configure SSL-VPN Settings
![[Pasted image 20251104204052.png]]

- **Requirement:** Link **User Groups** to **Portals**.
    
- **Purpose:** Enable the main VPN service.
    

---

### 4. Create Internal Access Policy

![[Pasted image 20251104204301.png]]

- **Requirement:** **Mandatory** policy (SSL-VPN $\rightarrow$ LAN).
    
- **Purpose:** Grant access to internal resources.
    

---

### 5. Create Internet Access Policy

- **Requirement:** **Optional** policy (SSL-VPN $\rightarrow$ WAN).
    
- **Purpose:** Scan all user internet traffic (if split tunneling is off).
-

## 2.🛡️ IPsec Site-to-Site VPN 

### 1. Create the IPsec Tunnel
![[Pasted image 20251104212144.png]]
- **Requirement:** Define the secure, encrypted tunnel to the remote office.
    
- **Mechanism:** Use the **IPsec Wizard** (**VPN > IPsec Wizard**) to create a **Site to Site** tunnel. This auto-generates the tunnel settings (e.g., `ToRemote`), which specify the **Remote Gateway IP** (e.g., `192.168.145.131`) and the **Pre-shared Key** for authentication.
    
- **Purpose:** To create the secure virtual "pipe" that connects the two sites.
    

---

### 2. Create the Static Route
![[Pasted image 20251104212221.png]]
- **Requirement:** Tell the local firewall _what_ traffic to send _into_ the new tunnel.
    
- **Mechanism:** Go to **Network > Static Routes**. Set the **Destination** to the _remote_ network's subnet (e.g., `10.0.2.0/24`) and set the **Interface** to the IPsec tunnel created in Step 1 (e.g., `ToRemote`).
    
- **Purpose:** To route all traffic destined for the remote office's private network _into_ the VPN tunnel instead of out to the internet.
    

---

### 3. Create Firewall Policies (In & Out)

![[Pasted image 20251104212317.png]]

![[Pasted image 20251104212350.png]]

- **Requirement:** **Mandatory** policies to _allow_ traffic to flow through the tunnel in both directions.
    
	**Mechanism:** Create two firewall policies (**Policy & Objects > Firewall Policy**).
    
    1. **Remote_Out:** Allows traffic from `LAN` (source) to `ToRemote` (destination).
        
    2. **Remote_In:** Allows traffic from `ToRemote` (source) to `LAN` (destination).
        
- **Purpose:** To permit the secure, bi-directional flow of traffic between the two sites. **NAT must be disabled** on these policies (as shown in the main policy list).

#### 🛑 Important Note: Symmetrical Configuration

- **Requirement:** You **must perform the exact same configuration** on the remote FortiGate, but in reverse.
    
- **Mechanism:** The remote firewall also needs its own **IPsec Tunnel**, a **Static Route** pointing back to your local subnet, and matching **Firewall Policies** to allow the traffic.
    
- **Purpose:** An IPsec tunnel requires two endpoints; both sides must be configured to trust each other and know the route for the tunnel to become active. configured to trust each other and know the route for the tunnel to become active.
