## 🌐What is SD-WAN?

Fundamentally, SD-WAN is a feature that lets you intelligently manage all your internet connections (WAN links) as one big, smart "pipe."

Instead of just having one main internet connection and a backup that sits there doing nothing, SD-WAN lets you **group multiple links** (like your main fiber line, a cheaper cable connection, and maybe even a 5G/LTE link) into a single **virtual interface**.

The real magic is that the FortiGate actively **measures the quality** (latency, jitter, etc.) of each of these links. This lets it **dynamically pick the best path** for your applications. For example, it can make sure your critical video calls always use the fastest, most stable link, while less important traffic can be balanced across the other connections.

## ⚙️ How Do You Configure It?

Setting up the basics involves three main phases:

### 1. Configure SD-WAN

First, you tell the FortiGate which of its physical ports are part of the SD-WAN. You go into the **SD-WAN Zones** menu, create a "Zone" (often called `virtual-wan-link`), and add your WAN interfaces (like `port1` and `port2`) as **members**. A key rule here is that once an interface is an SD-WAN member, you can't use it directly in any other routes or policies.

### 2. Configure Routes

Next, you need to tell your firewall to actually _use_ this new SD-WAN "pipe." You go to **Static Routes** and create a new default route (`0.0.0.0/0`) that points all your internet traffic to the **SD-WAN Zone interface** (the `virtual-wan-link`) instead of a specific port. An **implicit rule** is also automatically created to handle the basic load balancing between the member links.

### 3. Configure Policies

Finally, you update your firewall policies. Instead of creating a policy that sends traffic from `LAN` to `port1` (your old WAN port), you now create a policy that sends traffic from `LAN` to the **SD-WAN Zone interface** (`virtual-wan-link`). This single policy now controls traffic going out _all_ your WAN links, allowing you to apply your security profiles (like Web Filter and IPS) in one place.



## Commands:

The command sequence ==**`config system global`**== then ==**`set gui-app-detection-sdwan enable`**== is used for **making the application detection feature visible in the SD-WAN rules GUI**.


The command sequence ==**`cd Desktop`**== then ==**`sh traffic-generation.sh`**== is used for **navigating to the "Desktop" directory and then executing the "traffic-generation.sh" shell script**.
