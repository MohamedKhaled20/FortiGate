# 🕸️ Security Fabric

## 1. What's the Big Idea?

Think of the Security Fabric as Fortinet's way of getting all your security devices to **work together as a team**.

On their own, your firewalls at HQ (`HQ-NGFW-1`), the branch office (`BR1-FGT-1`), and even your log analyzer (`HQ-FAZ-1`) are just isolated boxes. They see different parts of the network, but they don't talk to each other or share what they've learned.

The Fabric links them all together. They start **sharing threat intelligence** automatically and **pooling all their logs**. This means a threat seen at the branch can be instantly shared with HQ, and your admin team gets a "single pane of glass" to see and manage the security of the _entire_ company, not just one box at a time.

## 2. How Your Diagram Fits In

Your diagram shows a perfect example of this "team":

- **The "Captain" (Root):** The `HQ-NGFW-1` is the **Root** of the Fabric. It's the main "brain" that coordinates everything.
    
- **The "Players" (Downstream):** The other firewalls (`HQ-ISFW` and `BR1-FGT-1`) are **downstream** members. They report back to the Root, feeding it information and taking direction.
    
- **The "Scorekeeper" (Log Analyzer):** The `HQ-FAZ-1` (FortiAnalyzer) is also a key part of the Fabric. It's the central "scorekeeper" that collects and analyzes logs from _everyone_ on the team, giving you one complete picture of what's happening.
    

In short, the Fabric turns your collection of individual devices into a single, intelligent security system.


## 3.Configuring the Security Fabric


### Exercise 1: Configuring the Security Fabric on HQ-NGFW-1 and HQ-ISFW
#### 1-Configure FortiAnalyzer Logging on HQ-NGFW-1 (Root)

### Exercise 2: Configuring the Security Fabric on HQ-NGFW-1 and BR1-FGT-1

#### 1.Configure the Security Fabric on BR1-FGT-1 (Downstream)
